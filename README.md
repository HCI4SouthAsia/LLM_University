# Conference Paper Query Portal with Large Language Models (LLM)

Welcome to the Conference Paper Query Portal repository! This repository serves as a guide to introduce the usage of Large Language Models (LLM) specifically focusing on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Here, we discuss how to utilize a custom-created portal powered by GPT-3.5, facilitating the reading and querying of conference papers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide insights and resources for leveraging Large Language Models, particularly in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). We aim to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in processing and understanding conference papers, enabling efficient querying and retrieval of relevant information.

## Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a paradigm that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP). By integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models like GPT-3.5, RAG enables more accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Conference Paper Querying**: Utilize the custom-built portal to search and retrieve conference papers based on user queries.
- **Powered by GPT-3.5**: Benefit from the advanced language understanding and generation capabilities of GPT-3.5.
- **Python Language**: The project is implemented primarily in Python, leveraging its versatility and rich ecosystem.
- **Technologies Used**: Key technologies include:
  - [Langchain](https://langchain.io/): Language model chaining framework for efficient model integration.
  - [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/): Python library for extracting text and metadata from PDF files.
  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/): Open-source library for state-of-the-art NLP models, including GPT-3.5.
